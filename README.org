* prompt2
another prompt generator for the terminal

- Right now, just working on =git-status.{c,h}=, and using =test-function.c= to test the lib.
- Later, when the lib basics are in place, write a prompt generator for the terminal.

Sample output from `test-functions`

#+begin_example
$ bin/test-functions
CWD.full /Users/fimblo/github/prompt2 # full path to .
CWD.basename prompt2                  # basename of .
CWD.git_path +/                       # I'm at the root of the git repo
CWD.home_path ~/github/prompt2        # path to . from HOME
Repo.name prompt2                     # name of git repo
Repo.branch.name main                 # name of branch
Repo.status UP_TO_DATE                # status of repo compared to remote
Repo.ahead 0                          # number of commits ahead remote
Repo.behind 0                         # number of commits behind remote
Staged.status UP_TO_DATE              # status of staged
Staged.num 0                          # number of staged files
Unstaged.status MODIFIED              # status of tracked unstaged files
Unstaged.num 1                        # number of changed unstaged files
